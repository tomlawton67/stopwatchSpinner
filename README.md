# stopwatchSpinner
How about a spinner that shows us how long we've been waiting?

In many UI designs, indeterminate loading spinners or progress bars provide no real feedback about time spent. I propose a simple alternative: use a “stopwatch spinner” that visually shows the true elapsed time since the loading process began. The stopwatchSpinner includes tenths, seconds, minutes and hours clock hands, giving users real-time information and making no assumptions about how long remains. This method improves perceived responsiveness, reduces uncertainty, and maintains honesty without needing to predict process completion.
Prototype implemented in LabVIEW, but easily generalizable.
